#Goals:
1. Can be powered through: USB C and A, battery, and power socket. 
2. Large range of operation: 0-32V and 0-3A, with a reasonable accuracy of ~ ±5mV, ~ ±5mA and three decimal digits of precision.
3. Dual channel, isolated, linear power supply with constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) modes.
4. Continuous current and voltage graphing on a TFT display.
5. Small form factor, light-weight, and durable,
6. Power transfer profile (data) can also be logged onto the laptop through one of the USB ports.
